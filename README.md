# lanterns-script
Python script for Maya that duplicates and positions lanterns randomly for Lights scene

I created this scene based off the lanterns scene in Tangled in one evening to practice Python scripting and modeling in Maya. This script duplicates a selected lantern 5 times and it places each new instance in a slightly random place in space to simulate floating lanterns. It also duplicates the point light associated with the original lantern and parents that light to each new lantern instance.

This is a test render I created
